# Array Problems

## Count Prizes
Suppose you are given an _Array_ of lower and uppercase letters called _items_. Suppose you are given a second _Array_ of lower and uppercase letters called _prizes_. _prizes_ will not have duplicates. Some of the elements of _items_ may be _prizes_. Write a function _count\_prizes_ that takes _prizes_ and _items_ and returns the count of _prizes_ in _items_.
